# Take two lists, a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89], b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13] and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists (without duplicates). Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes.

a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]

common = []
a = set(a)
b = set(b)

for i in a:
    if i in b:
        common.append(i)
print(common)

print("\n20DCE019 - Yatharth Chauhan")
