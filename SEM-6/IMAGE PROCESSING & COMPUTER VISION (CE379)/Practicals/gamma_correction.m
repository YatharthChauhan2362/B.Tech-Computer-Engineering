This code performs gamma correction on the "cameraman.tif" image:
1.	The "clc;" command clears the command window.
2.	The code reads in the "cameraman.tif" image using the "imread" function and assigns it to a variable called "img".
3.	The "imshow" function displays the original image.
4.	The code gets the size of the image using the "size" function and assigns the number of rows and columns to the variables "row" and "col".
5.	The variable "gamma" is assigned a value of 0.5, which will be used for gamma correction.
6.	A nested for loop is used to go through each pixel of the image. The pixel value is raised to the power of 1/gamma using the "^" operator and then converted to a double using the "double" function. The result is then multiplied by 1 and assigned back to the same pixel in the "img" variable. This step applies gamma correction to the image.
7.	A new figure is created using the "figure" function.
8.	The "imshow" function is called again to display the gamma-corrected image.
9.	Another nested for loop is used to go through each pixel of the gamma-corrected image "img". The pixel value is raised to the power of "gamma", converted to a double, multiplied by 1, and assigned to the corresponding pixel in a new variable called "img1".
10.	Another new figure is created using the "figure" function.
11.	The "imshow" function is called again to display the image after the second transformation.
In summary, this code applies gamma correction to an image by raising each pixel value to a certain power and then displays the original and transformed images.
