/*Define a C++ Structure Rectangle with data memberâ€™s width and height.
 It has get_values() member functions to get the data from user and area() member functions to print the area of rectangle.
 Also create a C++ Class for the above program. Define both functions inside the class.
 Member function defined inside the class behaves like an inline function and illustrate the difference between C++ Structure and C++ Class.*/
